# Image Organiser for Obsidian

This plugin enhances the image pasting experience in Obsidian by allowing you to rename images as you paste them and automatically organizing them into assets folders.

## Features

- Intercepts image pastes and displays a rename dialog
- Automatically suggests the original filename (if available) as the default name
- Saves images to the nearest "assets" or "Assets" folder in the vault hierarchy
- Falls back to the vault root if no asset folder is found
- Inserts proper markdown link to the saved image

## How to Use

2. In Obsidian, place your cursor where you want the image to appear
3. Paste the image (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V)
4. A dialog will appear allowing you to rename the image
5. Enter your desired name and click "Save"
6. The image will be saved to the nearest assets folder and linked in your note
