Quick plugin to solve a workflow problem for me. Makes it so that when pasting an image into a note, a window pops up which allows one to choose a name for the image.
Then the image file is opened and the "Move file to..." context window is opened to be able to quickly
move the image to a folder of one's choosing. It doesn't return to the note but this can quickly manually be done
using the built-in navigate back command or shortcut.

The code for this plugin was generated by Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking.
